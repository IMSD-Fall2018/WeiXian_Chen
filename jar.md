# Currency change into a jar of coin

The idea of this project is taking EUR as the base currency and showing the exchange to different currency in the world. As this a unity project, the currency will show as number of coins in different glass jar will label that type of currency system that being using within . that will show how many 10 EUR exchange to other currency system.

Things I already know how to do is to spawn object, and make the model stand within the jar, but thing I do not know how to do is to spawn the object within a number of turn equal to a whole number for a decimal number data, which will be a issues this project.
